Absolutely. Here’s a **tight, high-impact 90-second pitch** crafted *specifically* for **Visa judges** — grounded, credible, and still bold. It avoids “hackathon fluff” and speaks in **decision science + payments language** Visa folks respect.

## 🎤 **90-Second Visa Pitch – “Journey”**

> **Opening (0–15s): The problem**

Most budgeting tools tell you what already happened.
But the hardest part of money isn’t tracking — it’s **deciding**.

At checkout, when a subscription renews, or when money is tight, people don’t need charts.
They need to understand *consequences* — quickly and calmly.

---

> **Insight (15–30s): Why current tools fail**

Traditional budgeting apps assume people behave rationally and plan ahead.
In reality, decisions are made under pressure, with incomplete information.

That gap is where bad financial outcomes happen.

---

> **Solution (30–55s): What Journey is**

Journey is **Google Maps for money decisions**.

Instead of dashboards, we visualize your financial life as a journey toward a goal.
Before you spend, you can **preview the route**:

* Will this move you forward?
* Delay you?
* Or put you at risk before your next bill?

No shame. No alerts. Just clarity *before* money moves.

---

> **Demo Moment (55–75s): Make it concrete**

If I ask:

> “Can I afford $120 shoes?”

Journey instantly shows:

* how many days this delays my goal
* whether it risks my safety buffer
* and reroutes my path visually

An AI Guide explains *why* — using real constraints, not advice or opinions.

---

> **Why Visa should care (75–90s): Payments impact**

Journey improves **decision quality at the moment of payment**.

Better decisions mean:

* fewer overdrafts
* fewer regret-driven disputes
* healthier long-term spending behavior

This isn’t another budgeting app.
It’s a decision-support layer that can sit *before* transactions — exactly where Visa creates value.

> “Journey doesn’t tell people what they spent.
> It helps them choose what to spend — wisely.”

## Delivery tips (important)

* **Speak calmly** — this isn’t hype
* Point to the map when you say “preview the route”
* Avoid words like “gamified” or “AI-powered” unless asked
* Say “decision support” and “pre-transaction clarity”

If you want, I can:

* trim this to **60 seconds**
* write a **judge Q&A defense**
* or tailor a version for **Capital One / Conway** as well
